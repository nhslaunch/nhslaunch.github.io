        <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
<p>
          We were inspired to start the Launch entrepreneurship clubs since several of our summer students wanted to share their love of entrepreneurship with their peers back at their high schools.  <br>We put structure around this and provided them materials in our pilot year, the 2014-2015 school year.  Almost 100 companies were started across ~20 alumni schools.  <br>Top teams come to MIT in the spring to pitch their ideas and receive mentorship to learn and improve their companies.
          <br>
          This year, we scaled to over 100 schools with over 2000 students participating, and will have over 300 schools next year.  <br>

<br>Club members start a company in teams, learning the entrepreneurial mindset and skills by starting real companies, using course materials that follow the rigor and standards of MIT.<br> 
Join us and our network of educators in changing the way students learn and solve problems.  <br>Members of our mailing list will be notified of our spring preparation webinar and course platform materials to get ready for fall.</p></div>

We buy these fruits, that would normally be thrown away, from farmers and process them to make pulp concentrates which are then sold to juice bars, smoothie centers, and ice cream parlors.

Taking advantage of the increasingly lucrative tutoring industry, OST provides a streamlined medium connecting high school students in need of academic assistance with high school tutors. These tutors are students that have taken the same courses in which the tutees are struggling, and can offer specialized experience that professional tutors cannot. Tutees select tutors directly based on their qualifications and availability, and payments are handled at their discretion in order to minimize friction. Revenue is generated through the option of premium tutor accounts and by advertising other relevant educational resources.

Instead of having to manually start and stop a device, InMyMind Camera allows the user to constantly capture up to 10 minutes of video feed (deleting a second to record another) without need for human interface. To capture a moment, simply retrieve the footage from any common cloud storage drive. InMyMind was developed to create an inexpensive yet reliable clip-on-camera to record every moment.

Why is eating healthy so difficult?

Currently the best option for local farmers is selling through supermarkets, which eat up 75% of the revenue farmers would have made selling directly to consumers. To conserve resources, local farms are focused on production rather than connection to customers. LocaFoods serves as an online network that connects local farms directly to individuals, businesses, and restaurants, making the process of selling organic food easy and affordable. By providing farmers a free platform to display their products and directly delivering products to consumers, LocaFoods makes living healthy easy.
