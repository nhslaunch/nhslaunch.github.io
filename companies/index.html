<b>Politifund</b><br>
</center>
Although many people care strongly about politics and hold an array of opinions about political issues, voter turnout in the United States is still at an all time low. To make matters worse, large corporations effectively block out the voice of the people through millions of dollars poured into lobbying efforts. Through crowdsourced lobbying, we unlock the power of the public by pooling collective wealth into lobbying campaigns started by the people for the people.<br>

</center>
As technology grows, people have started to spend longer and longer times on their laptops, especially in the workplace. Fatigue, combined with the lack of breaks, has created tremendous loss of productivity at jobs. In the US alone, for instance, workplace fatigue costs up to 136 million dollars annually.
<br>
Our solution to this problem is Atria, the world's first intelligent laptop biosensor accessory. It is a cushioned wrist rest with sensors which scans EKG in order to detect user anxiety and then reminds the user to periodically take breaks in order to relieve stress.<br> <center>

40 percent of all the food in the United States goes to waste. Most of this waste is generated from restaurants, grocery stores, and businesses. Why not do something better with all this food?

23% of neonatal deaths worldwide are caused by asphyxiation. These deaths can be caused by a range of conditions, from medical complications to a parent leaning on their child incorrectly. Our solution is a low-cost wearable for an infant's hand that would detect blood oxygen levels, and beep to alert the parent if levels drop below the optimum range. Our product aims to reduce infant mortality from preventable causes by improving response time and treatment effectiveness in life-threatening situations.<br> <center>

The market is a mess. Trading is complicated, risky, and takes time. Clementine, a web and mobile group investing platform, makes the market more approachable by minimizing these issues and maximizing your success. People work together in private groups to vote on trade proposals and make decisions as a single entity. Both returns on investments and number of votes are proportional to the amount of money an individual contributed to the joint reserve. Group collaboration makes learning the market a breeze, minimizes risk, and saves time. Collectively, we’re smarter, so let’s make smarter money. Together.<br><center>

Millions of prospective college students invest time and money into choosing the best college for them. However, when creating their list or once accepted into colleges of similar caliber, students lack the resources to distinguish between schools. Colleges offer biased resources and many students lack the means and network to find valuable information. We offer a platform for students to find the right college for them. Prospective students contact college students directly, receiving honest, inspiring answers about all aspects of college life. By creating transparency in the decision process, GlassKnit seeks to connect students, build understanding, and support informed decisions.<br>

1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer at some point in their lifetimes. Too often fatal diseases such as skin cancer aren’t diagnosed until they are in their terminal stages when it is too late for effective treatment. Self Check is a convenient mobile application that gives users reminders and instructions to perform simple self-checks to diagnose potentially fatal diseases early and increase chances of survival. If one finds physical concerns, this app offers the ability to connect with local clinics and doctors, warning users to detect and address diseases early on while they are easier to treat.<br>

When children with autism are overstimulated, it can take hours before they calm down. With autism rates increasing exponentially over the past two decades, many parents, not knowing where to turn for a remedy, have been forced to buy expensive products that only accommodate and soothe one of the child’s senses. SenSit, our de-escalation chair, calms the child by providing therapeutic relief to the most important senses. But every child is unique, so we have included a variety of customizations that address every child’s needs. With our product, the child creates the chair, not us.<br>

auxcord is a social streaming service that allows people to listen to music together. Users can download the auxcord app to begin curating a live, collaborative stream with their friends or people with similar music interests. People enter rooms organized by genre, artist, or mood. Once they have joined the room, members can queue up songs sourced from Spotify, YouTube, and Soundcloud for the group mix. Private streams also allow users to share music with just their friends or listen to streams by featured artists. Other members of the group then upvote or downvote songs, earning points and selecting the group’s personal stream, effectively choosing music better than an algorithm. Through this people-powered music service, auxcord aims to recreate the physical experience of sharing and discovering music with your friends.
